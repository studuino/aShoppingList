# aShoppingList
Ionic Live Shopping List App

## Before starting the project
The project is configured to use [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

To use this app, you have to setup your own firebase backend and override the configuration file in this project.

You can find the firebase configuration under `src/app/app.module.ts`

## Start the project
The project is started with the regular ionic commands.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `ionic serve` to start the development environment.
3. To build the project run `ionic cordova build android` or `ionic cordova build ios`. In order for you to build an iOS app, you need to run on MacOS.

An alternative is to emulate the app on a device or upload it to the ionic cloud. From here you can download the ionic view app and use the app on all devices.
